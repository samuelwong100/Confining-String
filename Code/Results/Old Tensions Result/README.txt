This folder is for the prelimanry testing result. Here, all the simulations are done
on a 10 by 10 grid, with h=0.1. All of the relaxation were ran for 400 loops. And the range
of R were taken from 1 to 10. The results reproduce the fact that p and N-p have the same
tensions. And the graphs show that the first 2 and the last 2 points perhaps shouldn't be 
included. I will rerun all of these with larger grid and different R for the final results,
stored in the actual Tensions result folder.
